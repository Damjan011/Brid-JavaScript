# Brid-JavaScript

Letters are created dynamically from a JavaScript array. 

Font size is calculated based on the screen size on which the file is loaded. 

Position of letters is also calculated dynamically to always initially appear on center, on every screen size. 

Random position is calculated by giving five disctict numbers on both X and Y axis, in the range of screen height and width. 

Letters are clickable only after the animation has ended (1 second). 

Interval is set to replay the game (clear html child nodes, append them again and randomize their positions). 

If the letter combination is wrong at any point, game is replayed immediately. 

If the game is won, winner screen appears.
